# OU-CS3203-Assignment2
A repo for assignment 1 (CLASS: Software Engineering, SESSION: Spring '22).

## What is Assignment 1?
It's a piece of software created to analyze a JSON file containing tweets (and related metadata) pulled from Twitter.
The code can:
  1)  Show tweets in a table format,
  2)  Get ID's of users who made those tweets, and
  3)  Allow search for a tweet using its ID.

## Code Requirements
To run this code, you will need to have NodeJS and ExpressJS installed on your machine. Then, run "node main.js" in your CLI to run the code.

## Notes
  * The code runs in the browser, at (localhost:3000).
  * Whenever you make changes to "index.html", you don't need to run "node main.js" to see the effect of these changes in the browser.
  * Whenever you make changes to "main.js",    you DO    need to run "node main.js" to see the effect of these changes in the browser.
